## 🔧 **Design Highlights**
- FSM handles **Red, Yellow, Green** lights for 4 directions (M1, M2, MT, S).  
- **3-bit signal encoding** → 001(Green), 010(Yellow), 100(Red).  
- Designed with **timing control**: 7s Green, 2s Yellow, 5s Turn, 3s Side Green.  
- Simulated and verified using **ModelSim / Xilinx Vivado**.
